- Specifically, install our package with ```pip install my-lib-0.1.0.tar.gz```. The package can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5Qt1bIeDXBIzmfHwUaxzw4byMRlyNKV/view?usp=sharing)  

# Experiment on the Python(Java/Python_GypSum) Dataset
1. Step into the directory `src_code/python(java,python_GypSum)/code_sum_39`:
    ```angular2html
    cd src_code/python/code_sum_39
    ```
    or
    ```angular2html
    cd src_code/java/code_sum_39
    ```
    or
    ```angular2html
    cd src_code/python_GypSum/code_sum_39
    ```
2. Proprecess the train/valid/test data:
   ```angular2html
   python s1_preprocessor.py
   ```
    **Note that:**
    It will take hours for pre-processsing the whole dataset.

3. Run the model for training, validation, and testing:
    ```angular2html
   python s2_model.py
   ```

After running, the console will display the performances on the whole testing of the python/java datasets and the performance on the cleaned testing set of the python_GypSum dataset. The predicted results of testing data with the ground truth and source code will be saved in the path `data/python(java,python_GypSum)/result/codescriber_v39b11_6_2_6_512.json` for observation.

We have provided the results of the whole testing sets, you can get the evaluation results on the whole python/java testing sets directly by running 
```angular2html
python s3_eval_whole_test_set.py"
```
And you can get the evaluation results on the cleaned java/python_GypSum testing sets by directly run
```angular2html
python s3_eval_cleaned_test_set.py"
```

**Note that:** 
- All the parameters are set in `src_code/python(java,python_GypSum)/config.py`.
- If a model has been trained, you can set the parameter "train_mode" in `config.py` to "False". Then you can predict the testing data directly by using the model that has been saved in `data/python/model/`.
- We have provided in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5Qt1bIeDXBIzmfHwUaxzw4byMRlyNKV/view?usp=sharing) all the files including the trained models as well as the log files of traing processes (in `data/python(java,python_GypSum)/log/`). You can download them for reference and model evaluation without running `s1_preprocessor.py` and model training. Still, don't forget to set the parameter "train_mode" in `config.py` to "False" for direct prediction and evaluation with these files.

# Experimental Result:
We provide part of our experiment result as below.
- Comparison with 16 state-of-the-arts, including 13 models without pre-training and 4 pre-training-based models.

- Qualitative examples on the Java and Python datasets.
  
    **Note that:**
    All the words in summary texts were lemmatized in the pre-processing, which is a common operation to reduce the vocabulary size in NLP community. For example, the word "specified" and "segments" became "specify" and "segment" after lemmatization. As a result, some tokens in the processed and generated texts might not fit the context exactly. Practically, such minor grammatical issues does not affect the human understanding of natural language summary texts. To facilitate the observation, we fixed the issues manually in the displayed cases. For example in the fourth Python case, the word "segment" generated by CODESCRIBE was revised as "segments" due to the context "a sequence of". The word "specify" was revised as "specified" in the third Java case. Besides, we removed the space between the words and their following punctuation marks to make the summary texts more natural.
    We make sure that all the minor revisions do not affect the meanings of the generated summaries.
