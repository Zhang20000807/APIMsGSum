The method checks if the `FastStringBuffer` object being appended is null, and if it is, it returns without doing anything. If the `FastStringBuffer` object is not null, it checks the length of the object and if it is 0, it returns without doing anything. If the length of the object is greater than 0, it starts copying the characters from the `FastStringBuffer` object to the current object, one chunk at a time. The method uses the `System.arraycopy` method to copy the characters from the source array to the destination array. It also checks if the destination array has enough space to hold the characters being copied, and if it doesn't, it copies the remaining characters to the next chunk in the destination array.
